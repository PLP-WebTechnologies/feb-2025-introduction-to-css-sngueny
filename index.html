        <p class="intro">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

        <!-- Subheading for special section -->
        <h2 id="special-text">A Special Section with Highlighted Content</h2>
        <p>This section contains text that has been specifically styled to stand out. Notice how the text is bold, green, and more attention-grabbing, thanks to the custom styling applied through an ID selector.</p>

        <!-- Another Paragraph Section -->
        <p>This paragraph is an example of normal text without any special styling applied. By using CSS, we can control the spacing and alignment of paragraphs to make them more legible.</p>
